Fighting monster need rework, but first :

- Actions need startup and tear down functions
	- startup : create monster, teardown : reset state
- MainProgress need to reflect the action state, ie : the reversed monster health
	- This suppose that mainProgress completion is dependent of the action progress

- Need a rest action, instead of going back to town
- Need more text displays : Fighting monster, resting
- Fighting should follow this cycle : going to pex (0) -> searching monster (1) -> Fighting -> (1).
	- We coming from town, enter at state 0. After a fight, restart at 1
	- This suppose setup and teardown may have their own progress bar
