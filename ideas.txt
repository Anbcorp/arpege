TODO LIST:
==========

- Fighting should follow this cycle : going to pex (0) -> searching monster (1) -> Fighting -> (1).
	- We coming from town, enter at state 0. After a fight, restart at 1
	- This suppose setup and teardown may have their own progress bar

- Implement monsters xp reward
- Randomize xp reward and fight values
- Randomize 'hits' (maybe tie it to dexterity attribute)
- Cap level to 50
- Implement death and gameover, also restart
- Implement fleeing from fight (with small chance to get killed)

At this point we will have :
 * Resting, doing nothing and fighting action
 * Permadeath
 * Probably unbalanced mechanics
 * Player must balance between figthing most of the time and resting or fleeing
   without getting killed


Juice Ideas
===========

* Fight log
